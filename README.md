# software-based-RTC-algorithm

Algorithm and tests for software based Real Time Clock 

Requires:
- Mechanism to comput CPU time in seconds accurately
- Setting a time/date
- A little storage (for the year, the real-world time when the time was set, the corresponding CPU time when the time was set)
